# ARMANets.jl
This is an implementation of ARMA layers and ARMA networks in Julia, based on the paper [ARMA Nets: Expanding Receptive Field for Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11609) (Su, Jiahao; Wang, Shiqi; Huang, Furong). The layers are a drop-in replacement for standard convolutional layers.
